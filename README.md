# Heart Disease Prediction Model

## A model made using logistic regression to read health data and predict heart disease.

This project was made as a intro to machine learning and flask web application integration. The data that was used came from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arezaei81/heartcsv. This is my first machine learning model, and the first web application I created. I used a basic Bootstrap format for the user input into the web application. I used pickle to save the model to use in the web application.
